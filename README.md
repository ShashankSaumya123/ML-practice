# ML practice
 Repo made to practice ML models.

## Flower Classification using TPUs
 My Attempt at the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tpu-getting-started/overview). Currently ranked #24 at the time of writing this readme (18/11/2023) with a testing accuracy of 0.9428. I have used Transfer Learning with a DenseNet model. The final Dense layer has the "softmax" activation in order to perform multiclass classification.
 The model performs a multilabel classification (104 classes) on flower images. The dataset used is given by the competition itself. 

## Student Grades
 Dataset taken from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) Contains the dataset containing information on students from two Portugese schools. The goal is to predict the feature G3 using all other features available (for ex: Age, House condition, Family size, etc)
